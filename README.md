## How It Works

### 1. Enter a Topic
Start by providing a topic you'd like to research.

### 2. Generate a Team of Analysts
With a single click, the system creates a **team of AI analysts**, each focusing on a specific sub-topic.

### 3. Refine with Feedback
You can review the analysts' focus areas and provide feedback.  
The system uses your input to generate **additional analysts** to explore new directions or dig deeper.

### 4. Automatic Selection
From the full set of analysts, the system automatically selects the **most relevant** ones for the research phase.

## AI Interviews

Each selected analyst:

- Conducts an **interview with an expert AI**, equipped with:
  - A **web browser**
  - **Wikipedia**
  - _(More expert tools coming soon!)_

- Engages in a **dynamic, two-turn conversation** to explore the sub-topic
  - Includes follow-up questions and clarifications
  - Aims to extract rich, focused insights

- Runs **in parallel** with the other analysts to speed up the process

---

## Final Report

Once all interviews are complete:

- The system **synthesizes the insights** from every analyst
- Then generates a **final, structured report**  
  - Clean, concise, and easy to read  
  - Ready for review, sharing, or further analysis

## Coming Soon

- Multi-turn interviews with deeper reasoning
- Customizable output formats (PDF, HTML, etc.)
- Integration with more knowledge sources and tools
